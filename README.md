This project is a body of work built to represent my knowledge and understanding of coding and development using tools such as html, css and so much more! Such as creating a flex box, grid box, learning how to align and position grid items and make them responsive. add animation etc...

this has been an incredibly difficult lesson for me  due to an unforseen emergency i had this week.
